# Machine_Learning_Algorithms
In this project, I have implemented four machine learning algorithms from scratch using pure python and without taking advantage of predefined libraries in python. 

Also, I have evaluated the algorithms on five datasets. First, I divided the dataset into five folds, trained each algorithm on four folds, and tested it on the remaining fold for all five folds. Then, I repeated the previous operation for ten iterations. The mean and STD of the results have been reported.
